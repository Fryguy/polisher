- polisher/
  - use linux_admin to run commands
- polisher/git.rb#update_to
  - use polisher/rpmspec to update spec
- polisher/rpmspec.rb
  - better conversion of new data to rpmspec format
- bin/gem_dependency_checker
  - filter search targets by command line flags
  - better formatting of results
- bin/binary_gem_resolver.rb
  - flush out analysis / lookup of dependencies
    available on the local platform
  - refactor / extract generic components into
    polisher library

- Flush out documentation, for both API and cmd line
- Add gemspec / Gemfile
- Round of specs, test all modules & edge cases
- Push updated polisher gem to rubygems

- Ideas:
  - Tool to extract/package vendored dependencies during
    gem -> rpm conversion / update process
  - Tool to convert Gemfile + RPM in various locations
    to yum repository which satisfies gemfile
  - Tools to trigger automatic builds / updates of gem
    rpms on upstream releases
  - ...
