- polisher/
  - minimize gem deps, add optional requirements that get pulled-in/activated
    when certain functionality is invoked (for ex pkgwat is only needed when
    querying fedora)
- polisher/git.rb#update_to
  - use polisher/rpmspec to update spec
- polisher/rpmspec.rb
  - better conversion of new data to rpmspec format
- bin/gem_dependency_checker
  - better formatting of results
- bin/binary_gem_resolver.rb
  - flush out analysis / lookup of dependencies
    available on the local platform
  - refactor / extract generic components into
    polisher library

- Ideas:
  - Tool to extract/package vendored dependencies during
    gem -> rpm conversion / update process
  - Tool to convert Gemfile + RPM in various locations
    to yum repository which satisfies gemfile
  - Tools to trigger automatic builds / updates of gem
    rpms on upstream releases
  - Generate rpmspec patches from forked gem diffs
  - ...
