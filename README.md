Polisher is a Ruby module and set of utilities aimed to assisting the post-publishing
packaging process for Ruby gems and applications.

Provided are a series of tools geared towards querying rubygems.org and other upstream
ruby sources for metadata as well as downstream sources such as the Fedora and Debian
distributions to cross reference various supported stacks vendored by each.

Also prodivided are tools to integrate and hook into various build and install workflows
used by both upstream and downstream developers to synergize operations and streamline
the packaging and support process.

The project is still in its early / conceptual stages, and all are welcome to assist
shaping its direction. See documentation and spec suite for specific usage.
